# Week 5: Programming Assignment 1 - k times
# Due on 2021-09-02, 23:59 IST
# Given a list of integers and a value k, print the number in the list that appears exactly k times. (It is guaranteed that thereâ€™s exactly one integer that appears k times).
# Input Format:
# First line of the input contains a list of integers
# Second line of the input contains a value k
# Output Format:
# Display the number that appears exactly k

# Week 5: Programming Assignment 2 - kth Largest
# Due on 2021-09-02, 23:59 IST
# Given a list of integers and a value k, print the kth largest element in the list. (All the elements in the list are guaranteed to be distinct).
# Input Format:
# First line of the input contains a list of integers
# Second line of the input contains a value k
# Output Format:
# # Display the kth largest element in the list

# Week 5: Programming Assignment 3 - Cumulative sum
# Due on 2021-09-02, 23:59 IST
# Given a list of n integers, print a new list such that every element in the new list represents the cumulative sum of all the elements until that position.
# Input Format:
# Single line of input contains a list of space separated integers 
# Output Format:
# Print the cumulative list
